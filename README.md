A common repo for all courses of the Games Programming semester


## AAI Final Assignment TODO
Abstract classes BaseGameEntity and MovingEntity based on the C++-code (from Buckland)

Explorer state / steering behaviour

Only call pathfinding when there is no direct way to your goal (either that or pathfinding returns path with only the goal node)

Add omnivore script states

Implement base fuzzy logic classes (see: book and sheets) (leave ones you don't need)

Use 3 fuzzy variables, of which one is consequent to the others; design a set of rules for the variables

tip: unit test your fuzzy variables

Report (in LaTeX?)
